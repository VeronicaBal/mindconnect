# Mind Connect
Mind Connect is a mental health tracker designed for patients who need to track specific mental-health indicators during the course of psychological or farmaceutical interventions. The app provides better visualization than a common paper-and pencil tracking , while giving the user the freedom to customize what they are tracking. 

Users can track mental health-related symptoms on a scale from 0 to 10 and visualize their evolution on a line plot.
Users can input their own mental health indicators and filter the plotted data based on month or by choosing a custom time frame.
